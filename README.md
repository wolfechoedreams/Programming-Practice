# Programming-Practice
All I'm doing is messing with what I learn about coding and trying to impliment ideas. A lot of these are starting with a single idea (like I wanna make a game) and me typing a word and then going with the flow of what AI suggests right now.
I don't know what I'm doing. Like, everything is new but so far any ways I've seen to "teach" me have failed so I'm screwing around and learning that way. 
If you want to peak at my work, just know it's nothing serious.
If you have advice, I'm definately willing to learn.
If you're going to be rude, please don't comment. Constructive critism doesn't have to be maliscious.
